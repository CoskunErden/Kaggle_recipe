# Understanding Recipe Traffic Using Machine Learning Models
![RecipeTraffic](images/recipetraffic.webp)


## Introduction
Why do some recipes gain massive user engagement while others remain overlooked? This blog explores how machine learning can predict recipe traffic using nutritional content and categorical features. By understanding key factors influencing user behavior, we aim to improve recipe recommendations and optimize user engagement.

---

## Project Objectives
The primary goals of this project are:
1. **Predict Recipe Traffic**: Classify recipes as "High Traffic" or "Low Traffic" based on key features.
2. **Feature Analysis**: Identify the most influential factors driving recipe popularity.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Compare machine learning models to determine the best-performing approach.

---

## Dataset
The dataset includes:
- **Nutritional Features**: Calories, protein, sugar, carbohydrates, etc.
- **Categorical Features**: Dish types (e.g., Breakfast, Dessert) and servings.

### **Data Preprocessing Steps**
1. **Handling Missing Values**: Used imputation techniques for missing data and removed incomplete entries where necessary.
2. **Standardization**: Standardized numerical features (e.g., calories, protein) to ensure compatibility across models.
3. **One-Hot Encoding**: Transformed categorical features (e.g., dish types) into numerical representations for machine learning models.

## Model Development
We trained and evaluated six machine learning models:
1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Random Forest**
3. **K-Nearest Neighbors**
4. **Support Vector Machine**
5. **Gradient Boosting**
6. **Neural Networks**

### **Performance Metrics**
To evaluate each model, the following metrics were used:
- **Precision**: Proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of predictions.
- **Recall**: Proportion of true positives identified among all actual positives.
- **F1 Score**: Weighted average of precision and recall.
- **ROC AUC Score**: Measures the ability of the model to distinguish between classes.

## Results and Insights

### **Model Comparison**
Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting demonstrated the best overall performance. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) struggled due to its sensitivity to feature scaling and class imbalance.

| Model                  | Precision | Accuracy | Recall | F1 Score | ROC AUC |
|------------------------|-----------|----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Logistic Regression    | 0.80      | 0.77     | 0.80   | 0.80     | 0.84    |
| Gradient Boosting      | 0.73      | 0.72     | 0.84   | 0.78     | 0.82    |
| Neural Networks        | 0.75      | 0.75     | 0.77   | 0.76     | 0.79    |
| Random Forest          | 0.71      | 0.70     | 0.78   | 0.74     | 0.78    |
| Support Vector Machine | 0.80      | 0.77     | 0.80   | 0.80     | 0.82    |
| K-Nearest Neighbors    | 0.60      | 0.56     | 0.67   | 0.61     | 0.53    |

### **Feature Importance**
Key insights from feature importance analysis:
1. **Protein**: The most critical predictor, strongly associated with user interest.
2. **Vegetable**: Significant contribution to recipe popularity.
3. **Breakfast**: Consistently highlighted as a high-impact categorical feature.

## Conclusion

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Logistic Regression**: Best-performing model due to its balance of precision, recall, and simplicity.
- **Gradient Boosting**: Provided strong performance, particularly for minority class predictions.
- **Feature Importance**: Nutritional features (e.g., protein) and categorical features (e.g., Breakfast) are strong drivers of recipe traffic.

### **Business Impact**
- Insights from this analysis can help prioritize recipes with high traffic potential, optimize recipe recommendations, and increase overall user engagement.

### **Future Directions**
1. **Feature Engineering**: Incorporate additional data points like preparation time, ingredient costs, and user ratings.
2. **Advanced Models**: Experiment with ensemble methods (e.g., stacking) for enhanced predictive performance.
3. **Deployment**: Integrate the model into a real-time recommendation system for recipe platforms.
